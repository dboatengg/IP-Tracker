## Overview

### Project Details

This project entails building out an IP Address Tracker application.

To get the IP Address locations, I'll be using:

- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).

To generate the map, I'll use:

- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com://leafletjs.com/).

In this projects, users are be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

<!-- ### What I learned

I'll use this section to recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
``` -->
